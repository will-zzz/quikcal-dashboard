## CSS Library

We are using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for this projectâ€”that means we never have to open a single css file. Directly edit the components through their classes.

You can find the docs [here.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

## Bar Graph

We are using [React Charts](https://react-charts.tanstack.com/) for the bar graph. Docs are [here.](https://react-charts.tanstack.com/docs/overview)
